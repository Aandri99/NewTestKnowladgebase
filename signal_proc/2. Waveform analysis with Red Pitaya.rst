Measuring External Waveforms with the Red Pitaya
#########################################################

===================
Introduction
===================
The Red Pitaya is a versatile platform that enables the measurement and analysis of external waveforms. In this guide, we will explore various tasks and questions to gain insights into the characteristics of discrete time systems using the Red Pitaya's web applications. We will analyze waveforms from different sources, such as the USB soundcard, PC soundcard, and the Red Pitaya's own DAC. Along the way, we will discuss important concepts and theories related to each analysis and understand how they will be applied in the tasks.

Bandwidth
===================
Bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies that a device can accurately reproduce. In the context of audio devices like DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters), bandwidth is determined by the device's sample rate. The sample rate represents the number of samples per second that the DAC can process. According to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, the maximum frequency that can be accurately represented by a DAC is half the sample rate (known as the Nyquist frequency).

For example, if a DAC has a sample rate of 44.1 kHz, its bandwidth would be limited to 22.05 kHz. Frequencies above the Nyquist frequency will be improperly represented, leading to aliasing. Aliasing occurs when higher frequency components "fold back" into the lower frequency range, causing distortion and artifacts in the waveform.

In the tasks ahead, we will experimentally observe the bandwidth limitation of the Red Pitaya's audio DAC. By analyzing waveforms and observing aliasing effects, we can estimate the sample rate (bandwidth) of the DAC. This understanding will help us assess the device's ability to accurately reproduce high-frequency signals and make informed decisions about signal acquisition and processing.

Bit Depth and Quality
===================
Bit depth is another crucial factor that affects the quality of the output waveform produced by an audio DAC. Bit depth refers to the number of bits used to represent each sample of the analog waveform. A higher bit depth allows for a greater number of quantization levels, resulting in improved signal resolution and fidelity.

For example, a DAC with a bit depth of 16 bits can represent the audio signal using 2^16 (65,536) discrete levels. This provides a higher level of detail compared to a DAC with a bit depth of 8 bits, which can only represent the signal using 2^8 (256) levels. The increased quantization levels in higher bit depth DACs result in smoother and more accurate waveform reconstruction.

In the tasks, we will examine the effects of different bit depths on the quality of the Red Pitaya's DAC output. By analyzing sinewave excitation signals in the time and frequency domains, we can observe the impact of bit depth on waveform resolution, dynamic range, and overall signal fidelity. This knowledge will help us make informed decisions about the appropriate bit depth for specific measurement or audio playback requirements.

Crosstalk
===================
Crosstalk refers to the unwanted interference or leakage of signals between different channels of a device. In the context of the Red Pitaya, crosstalk can occur between the input channels. Crosstalk can result from electrical coupling, inadequate channel isolation, or improper signal routing.

Understanding and quantifying crosstalk is crucial for accurate signal measurements and analysis. In the tasks, we will focus on analyzing the crosstalk effects between input channels of the Red Pitaya. By setting up sinewaves of differing frequencies on each channel and analyzing the spectra of the signals, we can quantify and visualize the cross-channel interference.

By examining the time and frequency domains of the captured waveforms, we can assess the extent of crosstalk and its impact on signal fidelity. Crosstalk analysis allows us to identify any signal bleed between channels and make adjustments to minimize interference and ensure accurate measurements.

Tasks and Questions
===================
For these tasks, you will be using the Red Pitaya's web applications and MATLAB to analyze waveforms and perform measurements. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the slides and the accompanying MATLAB script.

Task 1: Audio DAC Bandwidth
===================
Show at least one plot demonstrating aliasing in the time domain and frequency domain.
Observe the frequency of the aliased wave and estimate the sample rate (bandwidth) of the audio DAC by comparing the measured frequency with the expected frequencies for different input frequencies.
Expected Results:

In the time domain plot, the aliased wave will exhibit distortions, such as jagged edges or waveform folding.
In the frequency domain plot, the aliased wave will show energy at frequencies that are not present in the original signal.
The measured frequency of the aliased wave will deviate from the expected frequency.
Based on the observed aliasing effects, the estimated sample rate (bandwidth) of the audio DAC can be determined.

Sample Rate (Bandwidth) Estimation: Sample Rate = 2 * (Highest Expected Frequency)

In the time domain, higher bit depths will result in smoother and more detailed waveform reconstruction.
In the frequency domain, higher bit depths will provide better frequency resolution and reduced quantization noise.
The amplitude and shape of the waveform will be influenced by the bit depth, with higher bit depths allowing for more accurate representation of the original signal.
